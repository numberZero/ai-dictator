- Selling a vehicle if we cannot upgrade it. In fact i'm not quiet happy
after seeing it. And i'm not quiet happy if it's not there. Without it,
we keep trying send a vehicle to depot, and make it restart if we can't
do replace/upgrade, making it running/stop/running/stop... specially on
early days when the ai is running really low on money. And with it, the
ai is selling all its vehicle... This will be rework :p

get it back the fastest. This should faster & higher incomes.
