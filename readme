DictatorAI is release under GPLv2 license.
DictatorAI is originaly a fork from Brumi's SimpleAI (version 4, license GPLv2).
Some code is still coming from the good work Brumi puts on it, you might not see it without knowing it at first as i mostly apply my coding style even to brumi's original code to faster its understanding (for me).
But you can keep see who's who while checking code logic and design or thru Brumi's ai code.
His ai page is there : http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=44809&sid=324466cb50b1550e83e43014ee93ee0c
